## Pre-flight

- [ ] `npm test` is green locally.
- [ ] I have not added a runtime dependency to the npm package (the CLI is intentionally zero-dep). If I did, I explained why above.
- [ ] If I changed CLI behavior, I updated the relevant `scripts/test-*.sh` and docs.
- [ ] If I changed prompts or templates, I updated the matching tests and docs.
- [ ] I read [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
- [ ] Single focused change — not bundled with unrelated refactors.
