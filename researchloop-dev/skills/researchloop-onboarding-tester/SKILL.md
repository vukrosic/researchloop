# ResearchLoop Onboarding Tester

## Purpose

Test ResearchLoop as a fresh user would see it.

## Workflow

1. Create or pick a clean empty lab folder.
2. If needed, install the current local ResearchLoop tarball instead of the published release.
3. Let the agent inspect the filesystem and figure out whether it has a real repo.
4. Make the agent ask the target-selection question if no repo is obvious.
5. Make the agent ask the time-budget question once if the plan does not have a real answer yet.
6. Let the agent propose a first research plan based on the discovered repo history.
7. Save the raw transcript and a short summary into the dev control room.

## Output

- transcript
- short summary
- onboarding failures
- first experiment suggestion
- setup gaps to fix next

## Rules

- Do not give the tester hidden product-development context.
- Do not default to sweep-only suggestions.
- Keep the first run cheap and realistic.
- Keep the result local-only.
